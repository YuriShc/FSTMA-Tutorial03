    "Monte Carlo methods are ways of solving the reinforcement learning problem based on averaging sample returns.  We assume experience is divided into episodes, and that all episodes eventually terminate no matter what actions are selected. Only on the completion of an episode are value estimates and policies changed. Monte Carlo methods can thus be incremental in an episode-by-episode sense, but not in a step-by-step (online) sense. The term “Monte Carlo” is often used more broadly for any estimation method whose operation involves a significant random component."
